```
for bash shell, or 
```csh
setenv clusterSeeds 192.168.178.77:7777
```

run cluster-seed
    - Clone csw-prod
    - Run sbt universal:stage
    - ```$cd target/universal/stage/bin```
    - ```$./csw-cluster-seed --clusterPort=3552```
    
* csw-prod and run sbt universal:publishLocal 
    - ```git checkout 895d8184a```
    - ```sbt universal:publishLocal```
