    pvStat pvPut(channel ch, compType mode = DEFAULT, double timeout = 10.0)

    Puts (or writes) the value of ch to the process variable it has been assigned to.
    Returns the status from the PV layer.

    By default, i.e. with no optional arguments, pvPut is un-confirmed “fire and forget”; completion must be inferred
    by other means. An optional second argument can change this default:
    • SYNC causes it to block the state set until completion. This mode is called synchronous.
    • ASYNC allows the state set to continue but still check for completion via a subsequent call to pvPutComplete (typically in a condition). This mode is called asnchronous.
    A timeout value may be specified after the SYNC argument. This should be a positive floating point number, specifying the number of seconds before the request times out.
    This value overrides the default timeout of 10 seconds.

    Note that SNL allows only one pending pvPut per variable and state set to be active.
    As long as a pvPut(var,ASYNC) is pending completion, further calls to pvPut(var,ASYNC) from the same
    state set immediately fail and an error message is printed; whereas further calls to pvPut(var,SYNC)
    are delayed until the previous operation completes.

    immediate effect, namely de-assigning the variable from any PV it currently is assigned to. In order

    a transition clause.
